# 1. Set up
###
  In order to properly run the applications, Python 3.7 must be installed on both each computer that will be
  running the applications. Each computer that will be running the applications must also have the following
  python libaries installed:
    XInput      (https://pypi.org/project/XInput-Python/)
    Pygame      (https://www.pygame.org/news)
    Twisted     (https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/)
    Pandas      (https://pandas.pydata.org/)
  See their respective websites for installation information. Each of these must be set up in order for the
  applications to run.
  
  In order to set up the Cloud Service, the computer must be port forwarded in order to allow connections
  from other computers. A tutorial to accomplish this can be found here:

# 2. Running the Applications
###
  The suggested method for running the observer application is to open a programming environment and run it
  from there. This allows the user to make changes to the constants in the code, such as level length or the
  ip of the computer. This is the suggested method for running both the actor and cloud service applications.
  However, if alternative methods of running these are desired, then it is recommended to run the program using
  a command line method to prevent interaction with the code.
